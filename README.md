# Unit 1 – Generative AI Hands-On

## Overview
This repository contains the submissions for **Unit 1: Generative AI & NLP Hands-On**.  
The objective of this unit is to understand **core Generative AI concepts**, explore **Transformer-based model architectures**, and analyze how different models behave when applied to various NLP tasks.

The work focuses on **observation, experimentation, and architectural reasoning**, rather than model accuracy or training.
